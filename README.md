## My process

### Built with

- Svelte
- Vite
- Pure CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I has been using Tailwind for these projects, but quickly realised that I was learning Tailwind, rather than learning CSS.  I thought it would be harder without it, but it actually didn't feel that way.

I am very fond of Vue and I don't mind React, but Svelte is just lovely to work with. 

### Continued development

Having relied heavily on frameworks (component and/or utility) for most of work I did, going back to pure CSS was much easier than I thought it would be. However, I really need to get better at structuring CSS.  I'm looking at Cube.css as a mental model for working with it efficiently.
